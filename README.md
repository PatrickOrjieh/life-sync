# Aerosense Project

## About Aerosense

Aerosense is a 3rd year Universal Design Project, focused at improving daily living for individuals with asthma through universal design principles. Moving from wearable to portable, Aerosense is an air quality monitor that provides real-time data, historical analytics, and health insights directly to users' smartphones.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks PM2.5, PM10, VOCs, and other air quality measurements.
- **Portability**: Designed for on-the-go use without compromising functionality.
- **Mobile App**: Real-time data and historical trends.
- **Personalized Notifications**: (Buggy) Alerts tailored to individual health profiles.
- **Educational Content**: Understand the impact of air quality on health.
- **GPS Mapping**: Identify and avoid areas with poor air quality.

## Universal Design

The Aerosense project uses the principles of universal design, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for all users, regardless of age, ability, or asthma severity. We have conducted extensive user testing to refine the user interface and experience, making sure that the information is not only accessible but also actionable (future enhancements).

## User Testing and Evaluation
User testing was a crucial part of our development process. We used the think-aloud protocol, to gather  data on our system's usability and functionality. Our testers, including Seun (a first-year Business student with asthma),James and Tom , provided invaluable feedback that will directly influence the final design and features.

## Test Documentation
Our test documentation includes detailed test cases that cover both UI interactions and user experiences. We have recorded the testing process, issues encountered, and positive aspects noted by the testers.
